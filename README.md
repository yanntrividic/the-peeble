# the-peeble

*The Peeble* is an opensource and arduino based project designed to help patients communicate with nurses and relax when a crisis occurs. Some more information on the project can be found in the `poster.pdf` file. This project was developed during the 2021 edition of the [CreArtathon](https://creartathon.com/), a five days long hackathon organized by Inria, Societies, and Université Paris-Saclay at the Digiteo building in Saclay.
